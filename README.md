Project Title: Bank Account Simulation

Description:
The Bank Account Simulation is a Java-based console application that models basic banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It provides a simple yet practical demonstration of how classes and methods can be used to handle real-world scenarios like deposits, withdrawals, and balance management.
The program features an Account class that encapsulates account details, balance tracking, and transaction operations. Users can perform deposits, withdrawals, and view their account status, with each operation updating the balance accordingly. An optional transaction history feature records all account activities for reference.

Key Features:
Deposit Funds: Add money to the account.
Withdraw Funds: Safely withdraw money with balance validation.
Balance Check: View the current account balance.
Transaction History: Keep track of all transactions.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
IDE: Eclipse IDE
